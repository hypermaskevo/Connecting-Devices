# Cisco Packet Tracer Lab - Connecting Devices

## Description
This lab is a network simulation created in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, focusing on connecting network devices using appropriate cables and configurations. The topology includes:

### Devices Used:
- **Cisco 2911 Routers** (R1, R2, R3, R4)
- **Cisco 2960 Switches** (SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4, SW5, SW6, SW7, SW8)
- **PCs** (PC1, PC2, PC3)
- **Server** (SRV1)

### Network Structure:
- **Connections between routers and switches using FastEthernet and GigabitEthernet.**
- **Proper cable selection for different distances:**
  - **Copper for short distances**
  - **Fiber for long distances (e.g., R1-R3 at 3 km, R3-R4 at 250 m)**

## Objectives
- Learn to **connect network devices** correctly.
- Understand **cable selection based on distance and type**.
- Practice configuring **basic routing and switching connections**.

## Setup Instructions
1. Open the **.pkt** file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Connect the devices using **the appropriate cable types**.
3. Configure IP addresses and test connectivity.

## Notes
- Auto MDI-X is **disabled** for practice purposes.
- Consider the difference between **single-mode and multi-mode fiber**.
